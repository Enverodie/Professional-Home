<p>They know where they’re going-<br />
To the magical land of success-<br />
because they worked hard,<br />
played by the rules,<br />
understood the definition.<br />
Most do not.</p>
<p>They know what they’re getting-<br />
A handout of comfort-<br />
because they found their fit,<br />
their niche,<br />
their passion.<br />
Some will not.</p>
<p>They know what they’re presenting-<br />
An example of pride-<br />
because they are perfect,<br />
ideal citizens,<br />
machines.<br />
Few are not.</p>
<p>They know what they’re doing-<br />
Creating a monster-<br />
a system of titanium<br />
only built with moldy cogs.<br />
False prophets.</p>
<p>They found their way.<br />
I can not.</p>
