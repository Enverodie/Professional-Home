They know where they’re going-
To the magical land of success-
because they worked hard,
played by the rules,
understood the definition.
Most do not.

They know what they’re getting-
A handout of comfort-
because they found their fit,
their niche,
their passion.
Some will not.

They know what they’re presenting-
An example of pride-
because they are perfect,
ideal citizens,
machines.
Few are not.

They know what they’re doing-
Creating a monster-
a system of titanium
only built with moldy cogs.
False prophets.

They found their way.
I can not.
