When you’re driving down the highway at night, you never know what you might come across. I’ve encountered a lot of stuff. Especially on this road.

Like that one night when I saw one of those fuckin’ clowns. Dude was standing on the sidewalk by the last light in town. Past dark. Evil clown mask, typical clown suit, the whole nine yards. This yahoo starts chasing every car he sees drive by. Starts turning his head like a dog and holding a toy kitchen knife whenever he sees somebody. Like, come on, I know you’re just some dumb teenager doing this for kicks. Get a <i>life.</i> Or are you looking to <i>lose</i> your life? Because that’s what you’re doing, if you start chasing people around on a mostly empty street trying to scare people. You’re gonna get shot or ran over. Knock it off.

And that isn’t even the best of the random people out and about. There was that one night when the guy in a trenchcoat was sitting on the bench at the corner. It was like, pitch black outside and this dude just thinks it’s chill to sit out on the corner under the streetlamp past dark. And the dude was <i>reading,</i> like, do you have a home, sir? You should go read there. Guy had to be a drug dealer or something with the way he looked – probably had a gun on him, maybe some drugs too, but like – why the book? I mean, what’s the deal? ‘Ah yes, I’m about to make a serious deal off these kids from the three blocks of coke I got hidden in my pockets – oh and did I tell you the value of education? Stay in school, kids.’ Guy’s probably sittin there readin fuckin’ <i>Wealth of Nations</i> as he waits. What an intellectual.

You know, speaking of intellectuals, who works on the roads around here? I’ve encountered so many potholes on this highway, it’s ridiculous. Of course, it varies by location, but jeesus, highway department, do you guys even work? Like, at all? You remember that one street I saw a couple weeks ago? That thing wasn’t even a pothole, it was like a full-on <i>sinkhole.</i> Or better yet, like the highway department just decided to tear out a giant hole where they didn’t want concrete anymore. That thing was atrocious! That thing engulfs whole cars! I don’t even know if it’s <i>okay</i> to just call that thing a dip in the road anymore. And, man, I wasn’t surprised when I saw that one car sitting on the side of the street about halfway between Jake’s Tools and home that one night. I think its tire was busted. Wouldn’t surprise me with the number of horrible bumps I had to go through. Poor guy didn’t know what to do, he’s standing out in front of his little van scratching his head wondering how the hell he’s gonna get out of this one… Sweating profusely, furrowed brow – his wife probably killed him whenever he got home……. <i>If</i> he got home.

Yeah, I could have stopped for him, but it could have been a front and now it ain’t my problem. He has a phone, right? Everyone does nowadays. Except – ooh, he probably didn’t have reception. Reception is really poor out here for some reason. Bah, I’m sure he’s fine… But really, you need to consider this: do you stop for everyone having car trouble? Especially when it’s a sketchy time of night to begin with? The guy could have been waiting for someone to do just that, so he can take a shotgun out of his car and rob you. It ain’t gonna be you!

Then there was the time when that police car came flying through. Fucker almost hit me; didn’t give me a chance to pull over or nothin’. All I hear is a <i>wee woo</i> and get half a second to pull into the damn ditch. God, it was so <i>quiet</i> that night. Maybe the trees absorb sound. Maybe the <i>snow</i> absorbs sound. It <i>was</i> early December… I think I remember it snowing pretty hard that night. Then the tire almost got stuck in the mud, like, you almost got me stranded out here, YOU should be the one getting arrested. Where did you go to police academy? Probably the same place where these road workers came from.

And then the <i>animals.</i> You remember the night that one thing – cougar, right? – ran across the right side of the road? Tan fur? When did we start getting those here? I’ve never seen an animal that big – that wasn’t behind a cage. Thank God we were in this car. I think it had something in its mouth, too. Seemed like a small dog… or could have been another cat. I don’t remember… I <i>think</i> it came from the woods, though I do remember a metal fence nearby. Maybe it <i>was</i> somebody’s cat. Man, think of how fast those creatures can run. That cougar would have to be really smart… and <i>fast…</i> to get a housecat…

I hope the guy who got stranded didn’t get eaten by one. Man it’s gotta suck being stranded out here alone.

Speaking of wild animals, remember the time we saw the first deer on the highway? And we freaked all out and slammed on the breaks? Man that thing scared the shit out of me! And then we just sat there, looking at its beady little eyes as it didn’t know what to do… You gotta know when to hit the brakes; if you didn’t you would have plowed straight through that thing and left a nasty smash in the window at best – or at worst… we’d be sooo dead. We definitely don’t want that. Noooo we don’t want that. And then think of the poor deer! Yeah, I know what you’re thinking: ‘but then it’s beady little eyes would turn to glass and we wouldn’t have to deal with it looking at us anymore.’ To that I respond: ‘yeah, you probably have a point.’ And I wouldn’t have to sit there for a full-on minute looking at it, having it look at me, wondering if it’s actually gonna turn on us. Have deers ever turned on people? Do they ever turn on people?


I wonder if those barrels were cleaned up from the other week. Just… random barrels sitting in the pit on the side of the road. I hope they weren’t radioactive… well we haven’t developed cancer yet, so I guess we’ll be fine. I didn’t see any as we were passing that corner earlier, but then again, I think it’s darker this night than before. But seriously, is that even allowed? I thought they dumped that shit in the ocean, not where people go hunting. If it <i>were</i> radioactive waste – which I doubt – it would seep into the ground and poison the soil, and it would poison the surrounding environment, and it would poison the game, and, hell, maybe even the passer-byers on the street… Maybe we should do more research into the effects of radiation. All that’s probably just stuff from the movies. Well, whoever put them there, I hope they know what they’re doing. It couldn’t have been radioactive. Naw, no way. People aren’t <i>that</i> stupid… right? Yeah, maybe not. Maybe. Maybe not.

And then think of all the dumbass kids finding those barrels. What they could do.

Ohhh, wait… What about that one house… could it have had something to do with that? Or… could they have – they might have found the barrels, or maybe they put them there, or… we suppose it wouldn’t really matter… but like, that house was creepy as fuck. It was just this… really broken down old wooden shack of a home, but the one time we drove by it it had its door wide open; all black inside. Couldn’t see nothing. Couldn’t see nothin’ in any of the windows either; they were all pitch black too. Except for the basement window. Someone had a light on in the basement… it wasn’t like a normal house light though. More like an intensified candle. And then there was this truck sitting in the driveway with its headlights on. We saw a couple barrels on the side of the house, same size… but they weren’t the same color.

Now that we’re thinking about it, you know, that light seemed a lot like an old handheld oil lantern. Kinda like the one we saw that one figure have a couple months ago as he was in the middle of the field…… digging. We’re thinking it was the underdeveloped stretch between Fulton Woods and Carey Woods. He had his back to the car as we passed, but he definitely had a shovel in his hand and an iron rod to hang the lantern on. It was tough to see anything below his knees with how tall that grass was.


…And then there was the time those spikes and jagged metal pieces strewn about the street. A two-way street. There was no way around them. Who does that? There’s no way that wasn’t intentional. Someone laid out those scraps to bust tires. The shrapnel or whatever-the-hell-it-was went down the street like two car lengths. No way we’d get through that one with our tires intact. It’s hard to know if it was done intentionally for malicious reasons, though we doubt the police would use tire-poppers that crude. Either way, we turned around and went back. It probably wasn’t a <i>legal</i> u-turn, but a justified one. There’s no <i>way</i> we were going to risk popped tires. So then we had to go allllll the way back to the shop, go alllllll the way through the county’s northern road, just to loop around and get back home.

And to think. That particular area must really be wacked, because a couple days later – when all the shrapnel or whatever was cleared up – we saw that little blue blanket by the roadside. We’re sure it was a blanket. No doubt about it. But… something was <i>wrapped</i> in it. We were thinking the thing was moving, but as we got closer and passed it… it was still… It could have been a used up blanket some little kid got sick of and threw out the window of his mom’s car or something… maybe he put a little wooden truck in it or maybe his mom’s empty plastic cup or something. Maybe our eyes had been playing tricks on us. We have that tendency to get mighty exhausted after a long day at the tool shop… maybe… maybe…


Perhaps the strangest we’ve seen was the severed human arm right on the outskirts of Carey Woods. It’s like… there was <i>nothing there!</i> No blood, no weapons, no fences nor property nor signs of life… just… trees... The arm looked like it had been… ripped off from the elbow. We need to get that image out of our head… imagining it lying limp there on the ground on our driver side of the car... The bone was sticking out… the flesh, it was so red and fresh-looking… but the skin was so pale… Yeah, we got the <i>hell</i> out of there after that.

It could have been an illusion, we suppose… <i>but man did it look real…</i>


Yes’sir, we’ve encountered a lot of stuff on the nighttime road…


We’ve encountered a voice in our head, calling itself “we” and telling us what we might come across.

You sometimes come across the fact that you’re – we’re all alone – no, together, we’re all together – in this car… together… together…

We filled our car with gas, right?
