<p>I’m a cool boy with a new toy -<br />
Cruisin’ through Walmart on my ride.<br />
Takin’ a start on this blue poptart - <br />
It’s all good,<br />
Granny didn’t need an electric cart.</p>
<p>I’m a real dude with an attitude -<br />
Flippin’ off people, havin’ fun.<br />
Stranded on her knees with heart disease,<br />
It’s all good,<br />
The lady makes me look quick as a breeze.</p>
<p>I go to the gym at ten A.M-<br />
Wear myself out from all the burn;<br />
And now I’m shoppin’ at this ol’ store<br />
It’s all good,<br />
Not standing on the muscle I tore.</p>
<p>I’m not a fink, I’d like to think<br />
That I’m a great dude to be around.<br />
And sometimes they have to consider-<br />
It’s all good,<br />
Y’all can be just a little bit bitter.</p>
<p>But to be fair, I have to care;<br />
Livin’ the street life, it ain’t easy.<br />
While I continue making two bucks a year<br />
It’s all good,<br />
She just keeps suckin’ up the atmosphere.</p>
<p>I’m an oppressed boy, I got no choice.<br />
Cops wrestle me down to the ground;<br />
But when I’m on the store’s cripple cart<br />
It’s not okay,<br />
They get me anyway—</p>
