<p>The store was mostly empty. The silent fluorescent lights above cast down onto the white tile floor, unfiltered by life. The delicatessen area was dark, empty, abandoned since ten that evening. The cash registers were empty, their screens black. The shelves were chaotic; cans of vegetables in desperate need of reorganization, flour cowering in the back of the bottom shelves, some products completely gone from their places.</p>
<p>Towards the back of the store, in the vacuum of silence, pouts of noise resonated throughout the area. <i>Thunk, sliiiiide. Thunk, sliiiide. Thunk, sliiide.</i> The sound of another box being slashed open with a cheap box cutter. <i>Pop. Rrrrrip. Swishhh.</i></p>
<p>Paul never counted the number of boxes he put up per night. The best he could do was an unstructured count. Just… counting. Something he did all night, every night. It kept his mind off things. <i>One… two… three… four… forty-six… forty-seven… forty-eight…</i></p>
<p>The store had five nightly employees total. It was never really five. Paul was always assigned the slowest nights, so he never saw a soul. Nobody wanted to work at a grocery store in a town of barely over a thousand people past 3 am. The only other employees were spirits, little dust clouds that roamed the hallways after closing time. They never bothered Paul. Spirits clash with other spirits, but Paul’s was long gone.</p>
<p><i>Thunk, sliiiide. Thunk, sliiide.</i></p>
<p>Paul slowly moved the rusty grey u-boat to the baking section. It squeaked once, before giving way to the old man’s mild pull. The cart shuddered and rattled as the metal pieces clashed. As he went, he could hear flour bags being stacked on one another. He looked up and saw another man sitting on a stepping stool, loading the bottom shelf with flour. The man looked up at Paul and smiled. He was a middle-age man with a moderate build. He had a hardened face but friendly eyes. He had brown hair all up his wide hands and arms. His nametag said “Dale.” Paul just stared.</p>
<p>“Why hello, uh, Paul!” Dale’s eyes flicked to Paul’s nametag before offering out his left hand to shake. “How long you been working here?”</p>
<p>Paul stared past the aisle.</p>
<p>“All my life it seems.”</p>
<p>Dale chuckled. “Yeah, I get that.” Paul pulled the u-boat against the shelves and began unloading.</p>
<p>Dale continued. “Was working as a night stock for a couple years down at the Walmart couple miles away. Got tired of that. Tried a day job, almost got the boot, I left. Wasn’t gonna screw up my image on a job I couldn’t handle, yuh know? Eh, so now I’m back here.”</p>
<p>Paul cracked open a box of artificial sugar, glanced in the box, took two, and put them on an empty shelf spot. He said nothing.</p>
<p>“I want to get out of the night shift hours, yuh know, but finding something that fits me, it’s… it’s hard, man. Like, my body cannot physically adjust to days anymore. ‘Ts like I’m a vampire or som’n like that, like yuh know, those super scary vampires that my son always hangs out with for Halloween.” Dale’s voice gradually vitalizes at the thought of his son. He paused. “Hey Paul, you have a son?... Daughter?”</p>
<p>Paul said nothing. After a moment, he replied. “I had one.”</p>
<p>“Oh! <span class="censored">Damn, fuck,</span> I’m sorry man. I won’t say no more.”</p>
<p>The hallways fell to silence as the two put away stock. Paul moved through the supply at a remarkable pace, but his movements didn’t reflect any rush. Paul was like an eraser, gliding past the messy shelves and leaving behind everything in its place. Dale, clearly experienced in stocking himself, made a clear effort to keep up. He popped open the cardboard boxes with increasing fervor and put down the contents with increasing speed, but still struggled to match Paul’s pace.</p>
<br />
<p>The next night, Dale found Paul running backstock of dining ware. It was 12:59.</p>
<p>“Heya Paul! Would ya like some help with that?” Dale pointed to Paul’s cart. “I’d be glad to help ya out, t’s always nice to have someone else to talk to.”</p>
<p>Paul bobbed his head. Dale couldn’t tell if it was supposed to be a nod of agreement, a mere acknowledgement, or neither. Paul grabbed a little box of clear plastic forks and walked to the other end of the aisle, his back to Dale. Dale took the last boxes of a similar brand and followed.</p>
<p>“So, what’s your favorite thing to do outside of work?” Dale asked. Paul thought for a moment.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Nothing, anymore, really.”</p>
<p>“B’aw, noo, there’s gotta be sum’n! What about… chess? You look like a chess guy!”</p>
<p>Paul shakes his head. “Playing against myself isn’t interesting anymore.”</p>
<p>“Oh, well, what about the internet? Do you go on the internet?”</p>
<p>“Computers aren’t my speed. Leave them to the kids.”</p>
<p>“Oh, then you gotta be a reader. Whatchu read?”</p>
<p>“Newspapers. Every so often.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>The conversation ended there.</p>
<br />
<p>The next night, at 3:42, Dale filled the shelves of chips and crackers. He had a big shopping cart, loaded past maximum capacity with cracker boxes and the bags of air. The plastic bags crinkled as Dale took firm grasps on the top. He saw Paul finishing up another cart in the adjacent aisle.</p>
<p>“Hey, would’ja like to help when you’re finished?” Dale smiled. Paul finished the cart and dragged it over to Dale, sitting it on the back wall and out of the way. He walked over to Dale’s cart and picked up a chip bag. Another one. He shuffled to their spot on the shelf and sat them down. While the bags of chips cried out in Dale’s grasp, they sat completely silent in Paul’s – like they were filled with dust.</p>
<p>“So, is it usually this lively?” Dale grinned.</p>
<p>Paul looked around. “Yeah.”</p>
<p>“You know, I used to hear a bunch of crickets and cars and… lights buzzing at my other night job. I don’t hear that here.” Dale looked at the ceiling, at the back wall, at the point on the floor where the shelves rest.</p>
<p>“You get used to it.”</p>
<br />
<p>The next night, at 4:37, Paul mopped the aisles. The mop made a distinctive <i>swish, swish</i> as the dirt vanished from the floor. The water bucket, mildly filled with soapy water, was very light. It glided along the floor and made little sound. The sound of a steady <i>rolllllllllllll</i> filled the dusty atmosphere and left behind it a white tile floor and the dusty apparition of spirits.</p>
<br />
<p>Dale quit the morning before.</p>
