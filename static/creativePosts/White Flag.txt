<p>There sits a red, white, and blue flag,<br />
slammed into the lifeless terrain.<br />
A foreign dust mass<br />
left that foreign object on the soil.<br />
It sits, without an inherent purpose-<br />
The colors’ vibrance foreign to this land.<br />
It carries the essence of Earth.</p>
<p>There sits a yellow and glaring red flag,<br />
slammed into the lifeless terrain.<br />
A shielded mass<br />
left that foreign object on the soil.<br />
It watches the other foreign object<br />
without an inherent reason for contempt.<br />
The colors’ vibrance foreign to this land.<br />
It carries the essence of our neighbor.</p>
<p>Yet another, and another, and another-<br />
similar colors, different banner,<br />
slammed into the lifeless terrain.<br />
They scorn each other silently<br />
in a foreign land,<br />
yet bearing the same essence of Earth.</p>
<p>Now the only flags to remain are<br />
silent, lifeless.<br />
Bathed in a seething white.<br />
Bleached by the same sun,<br />
the same strain,<br />
it bears our essence.</p>
