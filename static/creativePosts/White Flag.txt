There sits a red, white, and blue flag,
slammed into the lifeless terrain.
A foreign dust mass
left that foreign object on the soil.
It sits, without an inherent purpose-
The colors’ vibrance foreign to this land.
It carries the essence of Earth.

There sits a yellow and glaring red flag,
slammed into the lifeless terrain.
A shielded mass
left that foreign object on the soil.
It watches the other foreign object
without an inherent reason for contempt.
The colors’ vibrance foreign to this land.
It carries the essence of our neighbor.

Yet another, and another, and another-
similar colors, different banner,
slammed into the lifeless terrain.
They scorn each other silently
in a foreign land,
yet bearing the same essence of Earth.

Now the only flags to remain are
silent, lifeless.
Bathed in a seething white.
Bleached by the same sun,
the same strain,
it bears our essence.
