<p>In the valley between two enormous mountain ranges, a yellowing grass pathway extended from the bottom of the eastern mountain range. That expanse fell into a ravine on the western side, as though the eastern mountains tried and failed to grasp the western mountains. The towering stone halls were rough and elaborately sculpted from its long, stationary existence. The sun was about to begin its final plunge. The sky, still blue, greeted its first twinge of sunset.</p>
<p>Walking down the path was a group of nine men, draped in thin wool fashioned to a typical peasant’s garment. They all carried aged looks; wrinkles, scratches, and bodies moving like massive stone lumps. They were dirty. The brown in their clothes, the brown in their unwashed skin, the brown in the dirt at their feet, all seemed one in the same.</p>
<p>They had ropes tying their hands to their backs, and another tied to each peasant’s ankle. They walked in a single column. Behind them were three knights on horseback. The knights had black armor, immune to light reflection. Their heads were completely masked. Every piece of their bodies was covered in a sort of painted metal, from visor to elbow to knee to sole. White crosses with two protruding branches on each end glared in white on the knights’ back plates. Each piece of armor on each part of each knight’s body was pristine; not one scratch, not one speck of dirt could be seen. They were so polished that the polish itself seemed to protrude a fingernail’s length from the black paint. They were all completely identical as well – not a single unique nick or dent could be found on any one piece of armor.</p>
<p>The knights followed closely behind the peasants, who walked slowly along. The garments held in heat like a blanket on a furnace. A large mosquito buzzed by one peasant’s ear. </p>
<p>The terrain was unpredictable. What would seem to be a flat surface would quickly descend and cause one of the peasants to lose footing. The sixth man in line tripped on a stone the size of his foot. His stumbling created a chain reaction, and soon five others were face down in the grass and dirt. The knight closest to the man approached atop his black horse, looked down at the motionless figure, and jumped off. </p>
<p>“Get up, recusant. Oh, I’m sorry, should I ask nicely? Pleaseee?” Seeing the man’s sloth-like motion, the knight unsheathed his sword. “Loathsome freak! Pull your own weight for once in your miserable life.”</p>
<p>The man, pushing himself up on his dirt-crusted arms, turned his head to look at the knight. Instead, he saw the perfect point of a broadsword aimed at his nose. The diamond-hard rod of iron hurt his eyes as the polish reflected the sun into them. He could not see the knight; only the subtle dent in the sword’s right side, halfway up the shaft.</p>
<br />
<p><i>The blacksmith’s hammer clanged against the shining broadsword, a sound that nearly drowned out the yelling and chanting outside. Two figures stood inside the dim shop, the yells multiplying the looks of concern on their faces.</p>
<p>“The king has no tolerance for dissent. You know that. Put down this nonsense at once.” The furnace’s orange-red hue illuminated the blacksmith’s urgent look.</p>
<p>“Yes, I know. But… the king needs you. He couldn’t function without you. That is why you are so important to this movement.”</p>
<p>“I have a family to feed. They would not survive without me, here.” He replied. Outside, the yelling ceased.</p>
<p>“Do you want them surviving under his rule?”</p>
<p>There was another clang of the sword, a bit more passionate than before. </p>
<p>The blacksmith paused. </p>
<p>“Enough. I’ve heard enough, Malcott. You cannot keep doing this.”</p>
<p>He pounded the sword again. Outside, Malcott started hearing screaming.</p>
<p>The shop’s wooden door flew open, and the black metal boots thudded in. Malcott’s eyes went wide and his head darted over his shoulder. The blacksmith could only watch as his friend was identified, slammed to the ground, and dragged out of the shop in a matter of seconds.</i></p>
<br />
<p>Sweat poured from the man’s head as he lifted himself up. He had dark bags under his bloodshot eyes, and a stubble of beard growing from days of neglect. His hair was matted and oily.</p>
<p>“Why, not so vocal now? Why not? You sure had plenty to say in the village. Move!” The knight slammed the blunt side of his broadsword on the man’s back, forcing him forward and the line to continue.</p>
<br />
<p>“Malcott… is that you, Malcott?” A voice lumbered from the fourth position. The man was tall and slim with short black hair and a dark complexion. He looked back and saw the prisoner he was looking for in the sixth spot, caked in dirt and blood from his fall. A knight on a gray horse, pacing the middle of the line, glanced at him but said nothing.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m here.” Malcott replied.</p>
<p>“Okay. Okay. Good. Hey, I just wanted to say… I love you brother.”</p>
<p>“The fight’s never over, Calloway. Remember that.”</p>
<p>The fourth in line glanced at him briefly, nodded, and turned back around.</p>
<br />
<p><i>Calloway had climbed to the top of the village church, screaming to a gathering crowd of peasants and tradesmen, when they got him. It was their second day of public appearance, after several months of candlelit meetings in the tavern cellar and several weeks of subtle advertisement through banners, graffiti, and other untraceable tactics.</p>
<p>Malcott scurried through the busy cobblestone street toward the blacksmith shop, counting the numbers on his fingers. Nine farmer families had already pledged allegiance to the cause. Two tailors and their families. Six carpenter families. Five fur hunters. The tavern owner was completely onboard. </p>
<p>The blacksmith seemed sympathetic, but reluctant. This would be their final chance; the showing of strength they needed to win his trust, his allegiance.</p>
<p>Through the heads in the crowded street, Malcott could see a couple knights in black armor trying to climb up the church. Their armor was too heavy. Several commoners were yelling alongside a few figures Malcott had seen from previous meetings. The figures were successfully drawing out the villagers’ oppression, waving it in their faces, and forcing them to throw it away. As the knights scrambled to silence the figures, Malcott noticed just how thin their numbers were. There was perhaps one black iron figure for every fifty peasants in the street.</p>
<p>Shuffling through the crowd that gathered by the weather shielded hitching rail, Malcott made his way to the blacksmith shop. He saw another knight with the same splitting white cross on his leather armor’s backplate talking to the knights. They were nodding. The man in leather began successfully climbing the back of the church. As he got through the crowd separating him from the shop, he opened the door. Inside, he saw the one figure he came to see, standing in front of the furnace as a black silhouette, facing him.</p>
<p> “THE MEEK ARE –” Calloway’s cries were cut off as one of the knights grabbed him and hoisted him off the church.</p>
<p>The rest of the rallying cries faded behind him as Malcott shut the door.</i></p>
<br />
<p>Fifteen minutes passed. Rounding a small corner, they saw four great natural “pillars” extending from the western mountains across the ravine. The pillars were an extension of the mountain; like four select mountain peaks formed cylindrically rather than trigonally on the verge of the dim, deep ravine. The peaks were spherical at the tops; almost like a human face peeked through the stone tips. The two center pillars were connected by a thin, smooth stretch of stone that arched downward and exposed a rock protruding out of the ravine to the sunlight. From human height, the mountains seemed tall enough to perch only the highest-flying birds. The sun was mostly blocked out here.</p>
<p>“What was this about the meek?” One of the prisoners toward the front of the line asked.</p>
<p>“The meek are the foundation for civilization.” Calloway replied.</p>
<p>“The meek are the purest. The most honest.” Someone else replied.</p>
<p>“The meek are the humblest.” Someone else replied.</p>
<p>The meek always suffer.” Malcott replied.</p>
<p>The knight with the black horse fell back to the tail end of the line.</p>
<p>“Oh Lord… they’re talking again. Did you give them food?”</p>
<p>“I follow orders. No.” Another knight replied.</p>
<p>“Should we shut them up?”</p>
<p>“Let ‘em blab a little more if they want. They’ll be silent soon enough.”</p>
<br />
<p>As the group trudged closer to the strange illuminated rock platform emerging from the ravine, Malcott began to make out a small bridge connecting the massive, tilting stone block to the eastern cliffside. It was a light grey color, with a well-defined arch underneath to hold it firmly in position. This must be where they’re going, he realized. But then, why had the kingdom chosen this place, a sight of pure natural awe, for their execution?</p>
<br />
<p>One of the knights, on a handsome brown horse, galloped to the front of the line once the first prisoner reached the bridge.</p>
<p>“Halt!” He held up his hand. The line came to an unharmonious stop. “You all will be crossing here. We’ve herded swine before; we know the tricks. Sir Alphonsus” - he gestured to the gray horse knight - “is a skilled archer. If any of you even think of making a move out of line, you’ll be facedown before you can draw your next breath. No trying to cut yourself free from that dead bush over there, either.” He gestured again to a large, dead bush just at the other end of the bridge. It looked as though it had not been watered for centuries. It had sharp, thorny branch ends. It had no leaves. The branches twisted and turned like a serpent on fire, baring its fangs at anyone who dared approach. “We’ve had a great deal of swine attempting that one. Never worked.”</p>
<p>The knight waved his hand toward the bridge, and the prisoners began to cross.</p>
<p>On the other side, the wicked bush awaited them. The twisted branches’ dry ends prickled and cut the prisoners as they walked past it. When Malcott passed, his clothes were shredded beyond repair.</p>
<p>In the rock’s clearing, he could see the four great pillars from the eastern mountain towering over him. The sun was in his eyes.</p>
<p>All the prisoners moved to stand parallel with the eastern mountain without the knights’ instruction. It was instinctual. The knights ran on horseback to the center of the line, between the prisoners and the massive abyss separating the mountain ranges.</p>
<p>“King North has determined that we take you here. See it as a lesson, or a courtesy, or whatever. These mountain spikes across from me” – the man on the brown horse waved his arm behind him – “are very important to our king. The one on the far end to your left is meant to symbolize the prince. The far right one is the princess. The top one, the tallest one, the one on the left – that’s the king, and the one accompanying him on the right is the queen. Now, if you’ll notice, these peaks are far greater than you. Far greater than I. They are the most powerful beings in the world, greater than any one man, or any selection of men.” He paused for thought. “The sun will be going below that archway soon. It will not be the end of the day, except for those who cross the shadow of the king’s power!”</p>
<br />
<p><i>Malcott had sat on a rotting tree stump behind a wooden shack, next to a farmer with a light gray cloth wrapped around his long, disorderly blonde hair. The man wore a typical peasant’s garment, dirty and shredded from years of working in the wheat fields.</p>
<p>“I want you to look at those mountains over yonder, past the farm. You can take in the farm too, if you want to, but just look, over… there. Now, ya see it?” The farmer said.</p>
<p>“It’s beautiful.” Malcott replied.</p>
<p>“Yessir, ‘tis, isn’t it? Now, when you’re done absorbing all that I want you to look over to your right a little bit.” As the farmer instructed, Malcott panned his head to the right until he saw the king’s castle perched at the top of a large hill in the distance. It was a tiny grey speck of petty combative geometry with a couple blots of torchlight breaking through. Behind the castle, the mountain range flowed through the hill’s opposite side, making the castle look even smaller by comparison.</p>
<p>“Ya see that? Ya see that?” The farmer snorted. He looked for comprehension in Malcott’s eyes, but, unsure, elaborated. “That King North fancies himself a god. In these fields, in this land, I can see something resembling a god, but he ain’t it. That, my friend, is why I’m joining your cause. Tell the rest I’ll meet you in the basement of Theodore’s Tavern Sunday eve. I will help you in any way I can.”</i></p>
<br />
<p>The black horse knight spoke after the other finished. “You all have been designated for execution in-”</p>
<p>“The king is just a mortal!” The first man in line bellowed. The knights paused and looked at him. Their helmets masked any human connection between them and the peasant. The black horse knight unsheathed his sword and motioned to dismount – just as four more knights appeared by the bush.</p>
<p>They approached. In front was a man in a full black knight suit, complete with the white cross in back, on a red horse. His sword was drawn. The men behind him had second-tier, third-tier, or homemade armor.</p>
<p>“Is there a problem?” The black horse knight asked.</p>
<p>“Is this the group of King North dissenters?”</p>
<p>“Yes, and the execution is about to-”</p>
<p>In one ruthless strike, the stranger swung for the weak point in the knight’s armor: the chainmail covering the neck. Instead, the attack left a dent in the knight’s helmet at the chin. The knight quickly retaliated, drawing his own sword and thrusting the point at the man’s center of mass.</p>
<p>In the same moment, two other men in leather armor rushed past the third and sixth place prisoners. They dove off their horses, blades down, landing on the ropes tying the prisoners together. The line split into three. The grey horse knight drew his bow, aimed at one of the invaders, and fired. The arrow hit the top of the invader’s dominant arm, his leather too weak to prevent the arrow from going all the way through. Without a moment’s hesitation, he fired another arrow at an invader running toward him, scoring a hit in the upper chest. </p>
<p>“Sir Alphonsus, report this to the king! Request reinforcements immediately!” As the black horse knight fought his mysterious opponent, he rapidly turned his head to command the gray horse knight. He complied without hesitation and raced toward the bridge.</p>
<p>Just then, the wicked bush erupted in a terrifying blaze. On the other end of the bridge Malcott could see a fifth invader speeding away on horseback, carrying a torch. Malcott saw Sir Alphonsus’s luminescent figure reemerging from the bush just a few moments too late. He was a diamondback rattlesnake on fire. He tumbled off the steed right before its charred body crashed down.</p>
<p>Malcott, Calloway, and another prisoner were still tied together, and the brown horse knight was rushing toward them. One of the remaining invaders was now running between prisoners, cutting the ropes from their hands. Calloway’s ropes were already cut, but he had missed the other two.</p>
<p>“Sir! Toss me your blade!” Calloway screamed. The invader, confused, tossed him the wounded liberator’s sword. “Malcott, gentleman, you must trust me on this. Start running toward the cliff on the dirt side. NOW!”</p>
<p>Malcott unquestioningly complied. As the brown horse came dangerously close, and the cliff came dangerously close, Calloway embedded the sword in the soft dirt ground. The three tripped and fell. The brown horse knight, completely bewildered, could not stop himself from stumbling off the cliff.</p>
<p>As they got up, the three saw the other six prisoners free and fighting alongside the man in black armor. The black horse knight, unaware of the ground he lost, slipped off the cliff as well. The stranger in iron watched the abyss engulf the final knight.</p>
<p>The man in iron stood there, staring, for an eternity. He held his sword up and looked at it. The weapon’s unsurpassable strength and durability. The perfect craftsmanship. The iron, deemed more valuable than the miners who harvested it.</p>
<p>He looked at his empty hand.</p>
<p>Finally, he dismounted his horse. </p>
<p>Silently, he took in the colossal landscape all around him. He took a deep breath, took off his helmet, and threw it to the ground.</p>
<p>It was the village blacksmith.</p>
