<p>Aries was optimistic,<br />
for he had mastered the element<br />
used to cook food –<br />
wood, heat, flame – <br />
a blessed aptitude only capable by creatures<br />
enchanted by god.</p>
<p>Leo was dominant,<br />
for he had created the means<br />
to consume all other life –<br />
birds, bees, trees –<br />
a powerful ability only capable by beings<br />
with divine superiority.</p>
<p>Sagittarius was impatient,<br />
for he had found his power’s true expanse<br />
to create a new world – <br />
of wealth, of glory, of conquest – <br />
an entitlement only given to a race<br />
of godly souls and minds.</p>
<p>Earth was a matchbox.<br />
The god controlled for millennia<br />
has now been freed – <br />
of its barrier, of its custody, of its chains –<br />
an authority only present in the might<br />
of combustion – </p>
<br />
<p>And that god has a temper like fission.</p>
