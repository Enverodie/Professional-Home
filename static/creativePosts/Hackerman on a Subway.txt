The subway train sped from Columbus Circle
past the outskirts of Midtown Manhattan.
Maybe ten got on the car at this stop,
possibly up to twenty the last time.
All had blank stares, holding blank books, blank phones.

Hacker-man sits huddled in the corner,
on his massive laptop of blazing blue.
Typing to decipher an auctioneer,
his fingers moving with a single need
to weave into the machine and be serene.

The back wall and him were a solid weld;
steel met carbon, metal met transistors.
The sides, the keys, the monitor display
shined a mania in his backlit face
as another train met, or station passed.

Green flicks, pink flicks, from his closed-back headphones
nudged his head to a beat of electro
as his torn black shoes tapped down on the floor.
He sat quiet in a black fleece jacket
With thin-framed glasses reflecting his world.

It was a screaming sight, for through that glimpse,
You could see the world under his control -
merged with the gleam of passion in his eye.
There was a blank clock that spoke two a.m.,
plastered on the home screen of my smartphone.
