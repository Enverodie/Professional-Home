<p>The subway train sped from Columbus Circle<br />
past the outskirts of Midtown Manhattan.<br />
Maybe ten got on the car at this stop,<br />
possibly up to twenty the last time.<br />
All had blank stares, holding blank books, blank phones.<br />

<p>Hacker-man sits huddled in the corner,<br />
on his massive laptop of blazing blue.<br />
Typing to decipher an auctioneer,<br />
his fingers moving with a single need<br />
to weave into the machine and be serene.<br />

<p>The back wall and him were a solid weld;<br />
steel met carbon, metal met transistors.<br />
The sides, the keys, the monitor display<br />
shined a mania in his backlit face<br />
as another train met, or station passed.<br />

<p>Green flicks, pink flicks, from his closed-back headphones<br />
nudged his head to a beat of electro<br />
as his torn black shoes tapped down on the floor.<br />
He sat quiet in a black fleece jacket<br />
With thin-framed glasses reflecting his world.<br />

<p>It was a screaming sight, for through that glimpse,<br />
You could see the world under his control -<br />
merged with the gleam of passion in his eye.<br />
There was a blank clock that spoke two a.m.,<br />
plastered on the home screen of my smartphone.<br />
